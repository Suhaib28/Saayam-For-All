# Saayam-For-All

## Project Overview

This repository currently lacks a detailed description. Based on the file names and project structure, it appears to be a web application (potentially a static website) focused on providing or facilitating assistance (implied by "Saayam For All"). The presence of HTML files like `index.html`, `about.html`, `board.html`, and `register.html` suggests a front-end interface.  Further investigation is needed to understand the full scope of the project.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Basic Web Pages:**  Includes core pages like Home, About, a board page, and a registration page, suggesting basic user interaction and information display.
*   **GitHub Actions Integration:** Utilizes GitHub Actions for CI/CD, ensuring automated builds, tests, or deployments.
*   **Image Assets:** Contains several image files, likely for branding or visual elements within the website.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

*   **Web Browser:** A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) is required to view the website.
*   **Text Editor/IDE:** A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is recommended for development and modification of the code (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom).
*   **Web Server (Optional):** A local web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) may be necessary for testing the website locally before deployment.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

Given the potential nature of the project as a static website, the installation and setup might involve:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Suhaib28/Saayam-For-All.git
    cd Saayam-For-All
    ```

2.  **Open in Browser:**

    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the basic website.

3.  **Local Web Server (Optional):**

    If you intend to run the website locally with a web server, follow these steps:

    a. Install a web server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP for local development).

    b. Place the cloned repository directory within the web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` in XAMPP).

    c. Access the website through your browser using the local server address (e.g., `http://localhost/Saayam-For-All/`).
